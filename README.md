## Linting
Because I am neurotic, I like all of my code to be, if not correct, at least consistently formatted. And no one is more neurotic about code formatting than the folks over at [AirBnB](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) (seriously). 

Linting is, of course, completely optional. If you want to mix tabs/spaces, camel-case with snake-case, curly braces on the same line but, sometimes, not...Adventure.land will hum along just fine. However, if you are like-minded, here are the steps to setup your environment for ESlint:

Option 1.) Install eslint by running `npm install eslint` in the workspace folder `adventure-land`
Option 2.) Install globally using `npm install -g eslint`.

If you are using VisualStudio Code, I also recommend installing the `ESLint` extension.
